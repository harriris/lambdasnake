# LambdaSnake
Just another shady Snake game, written in Haskell.

## Keys
### During the game
* Left Arrow = turn left
* Right Arrow = turn right
* Up Arrow = turn up
* Down Arrow = turn down

### After the snake has died (collided with a wall or itself)
* Space = restart the game
* Esc = quit the game

## Known Issues & Bugs
* A catastrophe will ensue, if the snake eats the apple and there is no room for the apple to spawn again because of a long ass snake filling the game area. But this is OK, because you'll never make it that far anyways.
